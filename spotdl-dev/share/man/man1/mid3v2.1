.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBmid3v2\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fIfilename\fP ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBmid3v2\fP is a Mutagen\-based replacement for id3lib\(aqs id3v2. It supports
ID3v2.4 and more frames; it also does not have the numerous bugs that plague
id3v2.
.sp
This program exists mostly for compatibility with programs that want to tag
files using id3v2. For a more usable interface, we recommend Ex Falso.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-q\fP,\fB  \-\-quiet
Be quiet: do not mention file operations that perform the user\(aqs
request. Warnings will still be printed.
.TP
.B \-v\fP,\fB  \-\-verbose
Be verbose: state all operations performed. This is the opposite of
\-\-quiet. This is the default.
.TP
.B \-e\fP,\fB  \-\-escape
Enable interpretation of backslash escapes for tag values.
Makes it possible to escape the colon\-separator in TXXX, WXXX, COMM
values like \(aq\e:\(aq and insert escape sequences like \(aq\en\(aq, \(aq\et\(aq etc.
.TP
.B \-f\fP,\fB  \-\-list\-frames
Display all supported ID3v2.3/2.4 frames and their meanings.
.TP
.B \-L\fP,\fB  \-\-list\-genres
List all ID3v1 numeric genres. These can be used to set TCON frames,
but it is not recommended.
.TP
.B \-l\fP,\fB  \-\-list
List all tags in the files. The output format is \fInot\fP the same as
id3v2\(aqs; instead, it is easily parsable and readable. Some tags may not
have human\-readable representations.
.TP
.B \-\-list\-raw
List all tags in the files, in raw format. Although this format is
nominally human\-readable, it may be very long if the tag contains
embedded binary data.
.TP
.B \-d\fP,\fB  \-\-delete\-v2
Delete ID3v2 tags.
.TP
.B \-s\fP,\fB  \-\-delete\-v1
Delete ID3v1 tags.
.TP
.B \-D\fP,\fB  \-\-delete\-all
Delete all ID3 tags.
.TP
.BI \-\-delete\-frames\fB= FRAMES
Delete specific ID3v2 frames (or groups of frames) from the files.
\fBFRAMES\fP is a "," separated list of frame names e.g. \fB"TPE1,TALB"\fP
.TP
.B \-C\fP,\fB  \-\-convert
Convert ID3v1 tags to ID3v2 tags. This  will also happen automatically
during any editing.
.TP
.BI \-a\fP,\fB  \-\-artist\fB= ARTIST
Set the artist information (TPE1).
.TP
.BI \-A\fP,\fB  \-\-album\fB= ALBUM
Set the album information (TALB).
.TP
.BI \-t\fP,\fB  \-\-song\fB= TITLE
Set the title information (TIT2).
.TP
.BI \-c\fP,\fB  \-\-comment\fB= <DESCRIPTION:COMMENT:LANGUAGE>
Set a comment (COMM). The language and description may be omitted, in
which case the language defaults to English, and the description to an
empty string.
.TP
.BI \-p\fP,\fB  \-\-picture\fB= <FILENAME:DESCRIPTION:IMAGE\-TYPE:MIME\-TYPE>
Set the attached picture (APIC). Everything except the filename can be
omitted in which case default values will be used.
.TP
.BI \-g\fP,\fB  \-\-genre\fB= GENRE
Set the genre information (TCON).
.TP
.BI \-y\fP,\fB  \-\-year\fB= <YYYY>\fP,\fB \ \-\-date\fB= <YYYY\-[MM\-DD]>
Set the year/date information (TDRC).
.TP
.BI \-T\fP,\fB  \-\-track\fB= <NUM/NUM>
Set the track number (TRCK).
.UNINDENT
.sp
Any text or URL frame (those beginning with T or W) can be modified or
added by prefixing the name of the frame with "\-\-". For example, \fB\-\-TIT3
"Monkey!"\fP will set the TIT3 (subtitle) frame to \fBMonkey!\fP\&.
.sp
The TXXX frame has the format <DESCRIPTION:TEXT>; many TXXX frames may be
set in the file as long as they have different keys. To set this key, just
separate the text with a colon, e.g. \fB\-\-TXXX "ALBUMARTISTSORT:Examples,
The"\fP\&. The description can be omitted in which case it defaults to an empty
string.
.sp
The WXXX frame has the same format as TXXX but since URLs usually contain a
":" you have provide a description or enable escaping (\-e):
\fB\-\-WXXX "desc:http://foo.bar"\fP or \fB\-e \-\-WXXX "http\e\e://foo.bar"\fP
.sp
The USLT frame has the format <DESCRIPTION:TEXT:LANGUAGE>. The language and
description may be omitted, in which case the language defaults to English,
and the description to an empty string.
.sp
The special POPM frame can be set in a similar way: \fB\-\-POPM
"bob@example.com:128:2"\fP to set Bob\(aqs rating to 128/255 with 2 plays.
.SH BUGS
.sp
No sanity checking is done on the editing operations you perform, so mid3v2
will happily accept \-\-TSIZ when editing an ID3v2.4 frame. However, it will
also automatically throw it out during the next edit operation.
.SH AUTHOR
.sp
Joe Wreschnig is the author of mid3v2, but he doesn\(aqt like to admit it.
