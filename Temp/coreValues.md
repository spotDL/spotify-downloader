# What is this file?

Every project has a few core values (or at least should have a few core values)
that guide every decision/line of code ever written. This is where our core
values will be listed. They might seem silly but, you are expected to go beyond
the standards set by our values and turn in some truly well thought out code.

You might notice that all the 'core values' of spot-dl are in a two-part
format, what matters of these are the first halves, the second halves
merely serve as rule of thumb counterparts to their vague former halves.
As a coder/contributor to spot-dl, you’re not expected to merely satisfy the
rule-of-thumb counterparts but push far past the very high standards of
excellence they set. 

# Our Values

- Accurate Downloads - a user should be able to find and download the song
he/she/them want in under 3 attempts at max and under 1 attempt most of the
times.

- Provide accurate metadata - all downloads should have the correct metadata.

- Simple scalable design (Ease of contribution) - a programmer should
understand what does what and be free to start working on his/her/their
contributions in under 30 minutes.
